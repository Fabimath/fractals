## Calc Ray

We  need camera (eye) position at point $E = [Ex,Ey,Ez]$, target point where camera looks $T= [Tx,Ty,Tz]$, camera vertical normalized vector (which idicates where is up and were is down)  $v=[vx,vy,vz]$. We also need field of view scalar $f \in [0,360]$ (human eye $~90^\circ$):

$$
\begin{align}
t &= T-E \\
t_n &= t/||t|| \\
\end{align}
