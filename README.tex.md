## Calc Ray

We need camera (eye) position $e = [ex,ey,ez]$, target point where camera looks $t= [tx,ty,tz]$, camera vertical normalized vector (which idicates where is up and were is down)  $v=[vx,vy,vz]$. We also need field of view scalar $f \in [0,360]$ (human eye $~90Â°$)

$$
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
